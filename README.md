# deeplearning

I want to understand the theoretical properties of (deep) neural networks, and how to use these networks in practice. This repository contains my mathematical derivations of learning algorithms (e.g., backprop), simple Python implementations, and example applications (in the form of ipython notebooks). I will continually add to this repository as I keep studying this field.

# Examples
Examples for how to use the code can be found in the notebooks folder, in the form of ipython notebooks.
